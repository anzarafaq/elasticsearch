In 1997, he and his wife Karen purchased a larger, 20 acre property across the valley. In 1998 they planted their own 12 acre vineyard of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Zinfandel and Chardonnay - still a small family operation and sized to make only 2500 cases of wine annually, but now all estate grown varietals. They began constructing a new winery building and opened for business at their new location in September of 2003.
